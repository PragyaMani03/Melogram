    <h1>The Melogram Service</h1>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Melogram Service. The Service includes all of the Melogram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Melogram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
Offering personalised opportunities to create,lisen, connect, communicate, discover and share.
People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create,lisen, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Melogram, based on things that you and others do on and off Melogram.
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.
We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other instagram and spotify Products.
Melogram is part of both the Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience.
Ensuring access to our Service.
To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. 

Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.
We use data from Melogram to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Melogram.
Research and innovation.
We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.</p>
